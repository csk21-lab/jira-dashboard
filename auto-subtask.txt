Step-by-Step: Jira Automation Rule
1. Trigger
Set the trigger to run on a schedule (e.g., “Scheduled” every day).
Or, trigger when an issue is updated/created if you want instant results.
2. JQL Condition
Add a “JQL Condition” to select relevant parent issues.
Example JQL:
Code
project = YOUR_PROJECT AND issuetype != Sub-task AND "Schedule Type" in ("Weekly", "Monthly")
Optionally, add further criteria as needed.
3. Advanced Compare Conditions (Date Window)
Add an "Advanced compare condition" to check that:
Start Date <= {{now}}
End Date >= {{now}}
Example conditions:
{{issue.Start Date}} <= {{now}}
{{issue.End Date}} >= {{now}}
4. Sub-task Check (No Open Subtasks)
Add a “Related Issues Condition”:
Type: Sub-tasks
Condition: Status != Done (or Status = Open, depending on your workflow)
Set to “None match”
5. Create Sub-task Action
Add the “Create Issue” action:
Issue type: Sub-task
Parent: {{issue.key}}
Summary: Scheduled {{issue.Schedule Type}} Subtask
Description: Automatically created. Duration: {{issue.Start Date}} - {{issue.End Date}}
Set custom fields (Start Date, End Date, Schedule Type) using smart values.
Summary of the Rule Structure
Scheduled trigger (daily or as needed)
JQL condition for schedule type and parent issue
Date window check (start <= now <= end)
No open subtasks condition
Create sub-task with smart values from parent
